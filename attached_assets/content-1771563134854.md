## dxLink Overview

dxLink is the next-generation access layer for working with dxFeed market data services. It provides a unified, scalable, and secure interface for consuming real-time and historical data across multiple platforms.

Designed to meet the needs of modern client-facing applications, dxLink ensures efficient data delivery even over slow networks or mobile connections by using smart algorithms and back-pressure handling.

dxLink supports:

- WebSocket-based streaming and request/response models

- Token-based authentication

- SDKs for JavaScript, Java, .NET, C++, and Swift

- Integration in B2B and B2B2C environments. It serves as the backbone for dxFeed [Retail](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/dxfeed-retail-products.html "dxFeed Retail Products") services and IaaS solutions.


On top of dxLink, clients can also use [dxScript](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/market-search/dxscript.html "dxScript") — an embedded scripting engine for on-the-fly analysis and event generation. dxScript enables technical indicators, conditional triggers, and custom logic to be executed directly in the data stream, reducing downstream processing.

## Benefits

dxLink is a cloud-native access solution for scalable, secure, and developer-friendly delivery of dxFeed market data. It provides a single interface for consuming real-time and historical data across platforms, with features that simplify integration and ensure stable performance even under challenging network conditions.

Key benefits include:

- Unified access to real-time and historical data via a single endpoint

- Cloud scalability with autoscaling and intelligent load balancing

- Resilience under high load and slow or unstable network conditions

- Built-in observability with real-time metrics and alerting tools

- Enterprise-grade security, including TLS 1.3 and fine-grained access control


### Note

For maximum throughput and ultra-low latency in B2B systems, consider using [Quote Distribution model](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/data-model/market-events/qd-model-of-market-events.html "QD Model of Market Events").

### Supported platforms and protocols

dxLink is available on the following platforms:

- JavaScript SDK

- Java SDK

- .NET SDK

- C++ SDK

- Swift SDK


Each SDK implements a shared application protocol and handles authentications, reconnects, and subscriptions.

## When to use dxLink

Use dxLink if you:

- Build a web or mobile application that requires dxFeed market data

- Need a single endpoint for subscribing to real-time quotes, DOM, greeks, or candles

- Want to avoid low-level transport protocols

- Require authentication, session control, and observability


## Getting started

To connect to dxLink:

1. Contact your sales manager to request trial or production access. Once approved, your welcome letter will contain information about your WebSocket endpoint (e.g. [wss://your-endpoint.dxfeed.com](wss://your-endpoint.dxfeed.com/)). Read more on the [Getting Started](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/getting-started.html "Getting Started") page.

2. Choose how to connect. Use one of the SDKs or connect directly via API by y complying with the protocol.

3. Test your setup. Try our [demo endpoint](wss://your-endpoint.dxfeed.com/) and [debug console](https://demo.dxfeed.com/dxlink-ws/debug/).

4. Start working. Connect and obtain market data.


## Authentication and access control

dxLink uses various authentication systems and supports multiple access modes, and session types. The platform is flexible and can integrate with different environments.

### B2B integration

For B2B clients, authentication and access control typically involve the following methods:

- Static access tokens

- Dynamic tokens per system

- Whitelisted IPs or pre-negotiated entitlements


### B2B2C integration

In B2B2C scenarios, access is typically user-based:

- Short-living tokens per user

- Token access and permissions


### Access levels

Access levels are configurable for all models and define available features, data environments, and privileges. See [Token-based authorization](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/data-services/real-time-and-delayed-services/token-based-authorization.html "Token-Based Authorization") for details.

Examples:

- `demo`: token for testing purposes, with access to delayed data and demo endpoints

- `prod`: production token with access to live data and production infrastructure

- `custom`: token configured with specific entitlements and rules tailored for your setup
